                        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>We realize not everyone likes talking on the phone.  If speaking on the phone makes you comfortable, do your best to do it anyway.  The more you engage in this activity, the easier it will become.  Don't always do what is easiest - push yourself to break out of your comfort zone.  We recommend you do both - call others and meet face to face; try mixing it up a bit.</Text>
                        <Text style={[styles.mainTitle, {marginTop: '20%'}]}>This seems too easy.  How can it be helpful? </Text>
                        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>Take a moment and consider what previous participants have said about this wellness element.  Their feedback opened our eyes to the power of this intervention...see what you think.  Before starting the program, one participant felt she was very connected.  However, once she started tracking her daily socialization practices, she realized she wasn't connecting with others as often as she thought.  So, tracking increased her awareness and offered her an opportunity to change her behavior.  Another participant was extremely isolated and something as simple as calling other, allowed him to engage in behavior that increased his level of social connectedness.  So please don’t underestimate this intervention because of its simplicity.</Text>
                        <Text style={[styles.mainTitle, {marginTop: '20%'}]}>“Macro-socialization” and “Micro-Socialization” are new concepts to me.  Would you explain what they mean and how they apply to kickstart30?</Text>
                        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>Macro-socialization (large): Engaging in big social activities like joining a group or spending significant amounts of time with friends and family, over a period of months, years, or even a lifetime.  Micro-socialization (small):  Interacting with strangers, or casual acquaintances in brief social interactions -  nodding pleasantly, smiling as someone approaches, or saying good morning.  As an example, while on an elevator, do you interact with others or avoid eye-contact while quietly waiting for your floor?  If you avoid others on the elevator, you’ve just missed out on an opportunity to engage in a micro-socialization activity. Both macro-  and micro-socialization are powerful  ways to boost your mental wellness.  We encourage you to grab every opportunity to engage in both.  Practice stepping outside of your comfort zone and give both styles of interaction a try.  The benefits to your mental wellness will be worth the effort. </Text>
                        <Text style={[styles.mainTitle, {marginTop: '20%'}]}>I don’t have the time to meet face to face with friends or family.  I’m just too busy.  What should I do?</Text>
                        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>We realize hectic schedules make it difficult to find time to connect face-to-face.  If you’re not yet convinced of the power of socialization, we encourage you to review this element.  If you want to improve your overall mental and physical wellbeing, you must overcome this barrier and make time to connect.  The benefits far outweigh the hassle factor.  There is power in meeting face-to-face, and spending quality time together in person.  When that's not possible, connecting via phone is a viable option.</Text>
                        <Text style={[styles.mainTitle, {marginTop: '20%'}]}>Do I need to keep track of the people I meet or call, as well as the content of the communication?</Text>
                        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>No, you don’t need to keep records.  Simply log your practices daily using your Participant Tracking Form.</Text>

                <Text style={styles.paragraph}>Acknowledge your lack of drive/motivation as a common feeling, when deciding to socialize.  On days when you feel avoidant or less than social, do your socialization activities anyway -  no matter what! A couple of other suggestions:
Consider enlisting the help of an accountability buddy; someone you’ll alert each day letting them know you’ve completed your wellness practices, and
Consider practicing the 5 Second Rule on days when you’re experiencing low motivation ( see Tackling Low Motivation on page 45 for information about the 5 Second Rule).</Text>
