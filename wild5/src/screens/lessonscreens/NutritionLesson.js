                        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>Every single chemical and neurotransmitter in your brain is created from FOOD!  Yes, we are indeed what we eat!  If you eat poorly, both your mind and your body suffer.  One more thing to remember, excess calories lead to poor brain health.  By logging your food regularly, using an app such as MyFitnessPal or a paper diary, you will become more aware of what you eat, and hopefully, based on this increase mindful awareness, you’ll make changes that ultimately benefit your body, brain and mental wellness. Logging is crucial!!</Text>
                        <Text style={[styles.mainTitle, {marginTop: '20%'}]}>What is the MIND diet?  Why is it being recommended for Kickstart30?</Text>
                        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>The MIND diet is a research based way of eating that has been shown to protect both your brain and body.  The diet is easy to follow and emphasizes plant-based nutrition, with limited amounts of animal proteins.  This is a simple and effective way to improve your global health and well-being without too much effort.</Text>
                        <Text style={[styles.mainTitle, {marginTop: '20%'}]}>Is MyFitnessPal an easy app or website to use?</Text>
                        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>Yes, it is! The app is highly educational and motivational in nature and does a great job of increasing your overall mindful awareness of what you’re consuming.  Please download the app to your smartphone prior to starting the program and become familiar with its features.  This app motivates users to eat better.  IF you’re not a fan of apps, keep a paper food diary.  If you’re already using another food logging app, like Weight Watchers, there is no need to change.</Text>
                        <Text style={[styles.mainTitle, {marginTop: '20%'}]}>Can I follow the MIND diet for a lifetime?</Text>
                        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>Absolutely! This diet should be followed for years to gain maximum benefit.  It’s rich in good fats and limits bad fats (from animal sources), plus it encourages you to eat nuts, vegetables,  and fruits.  It’s a win-win lifestyle modification that pays off very handsomely in many ways.</Text>
                        <Text style={[styles.mainTitle, {marginTop: '20%'}]}>Is KickStart30 a weight loss program?</Text>
                        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>No, KickStart30 was not created to be a weight loss program.  However, there is scientific evidence showing that many people who write down everything they eat and drink on a regular basis, do in fact lose weight.  Keeping a food diary significantly reduces mindless eating which can be a major factor in gaining weight.</Text>

                <Text style={styles.paragraph}>Take the time to log your meals/snacks/beverages/alcohol throughout the day. Try best to avoid waiting until bedtime to complete your log. Keep up the practice, it will get easier as you go along. Add a reminder to log your intake on your calendar and set reminder alerts</Text> 
                <Text style={styles.subTitle}>Low Motivation</Text>
                <Text style={styles.paragraph}>Acknowledge your lack of drive/motivation as a common feeling when starting the practice of keeping a food log, implementing a new meal plan, and/or practicing mindful eating. On days when you don't feel like doing these activities, do them anyway - No matter what! A couple of suggestions: 
Consider enlisting the help of an accountability buddy; someone you’ll alert each day letting them know you’ve completed your wellness practices, and
Consider practicing the 5 Second Rule on days when you’re experiencing low motivation  ( see Tackling Low Motivation on page 45 for information about the 5 Second Rule).</Text>

            <Text style={styles.paragraph}>“I have already lost weight.  I’m developing a new appreciation of the taste of food.  I feel very strongly that the “mindful eating meditation” is integral to success with changing eating habits.  It slows everything down, maintains awareness, enhances the appreciation of food, and interestingly, when done appropriately it cuts down the amount of food I even want completely outside of my conscious awareness.”</Text>
            <Text style={styles.paragraph}>“I have lost ten pounds since the completion of the survey.  It has helped me feel better about myself.  This program has helped to show me that with a bit more attention to what I’m eating and some exercise, I can change my body for the better.  I never ate terribly, but the amount of sugar and caffeine I was using to keep going took a toll.  I feel better about what I’m eating and I’m happier that I am more active.”</Text>
